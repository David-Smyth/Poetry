# Poetry - A Distributed System Integrating Multiple Embedded Nodes with
# Multiple Server Nodes

This system uses WebApps at every node, each performing node specific
behaviors.

## Open Source

This application is initially created by  <a
href="mailto:Capt.David.Smyth@gmail.com?subject=Poetry">David E. Smyth</a>
under the MIT License, and therefore is and will remain open source software.

## Implementation Technology

This application is implemented using Ruby on Rails, specifically Ruby 2.0.0
and Rails 4.0.8.

The development process closely follows that suggested by [Michael
Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/) in  the [*Ruby on Rails
Tutorial*](http://railstutorial.org/). Hence, RSpec is used for test driven
development, with Capybara and Selenium for automated user testing. Hence it
is and will forever remain bug free ;-)

## Other things to be covered better and better:

* System dependencies
Ruby on Rails, of course. Also, OpenCV for image processing via the opencv
gem.

* Configuration
brew install opencv
gem install ruby-opencv -- --with-opencv-dir=/usr/local/lib

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
